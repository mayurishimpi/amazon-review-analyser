# Abstractive Summarization

Fine tuned the ‘huggingface-course/mt5-small-finetuned-amazon-en-es’ model
to get an abstract summarizer for the ‘amazon-reviews eng’ dataset.
X: Customer reviews, Y: Review summary
Used the books product category with 3756 reviews for training the model. Utilized the ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) metric for assessing the performance of the model, and as the training metric. The model required 48 hours to train, we kept saving the weights after each epoch. We were able to bring the validation loss down from 25.689 to 3.64 in 4 epochs, however, given more time we could reduce the loss even further to get better summaries.

# Frontend

● Technologies/Framework used: Next.js (React/Node.js), Ant Design, Tailwind
CSS
● Created a UI for:
○ List all products- GET API: http://127.0.0.1:3000/products
○ List all reviews by product id- GET API: http://127.0.0.1:3000/products/{product_id}
○ Add reviews- POST API: http://127.0.0.1:3000/add_review
● Integrated the UI with the Backend APIs with error handling

# Backend

We used Flask framework for developing backend of our application. Apart from the dataset, we generated
a file products.json containing product_id and respective summary generated from out model.
Following API endpoints are created:
● GET API: http://127.0.0.1:5000/products
List to all products ids and their summary. Used products.json file.
● GET API: http://127.0.0.1:5000/products/{product_id}
Retrieve summary generated by our model, reviews and sentiment of review with above product_id
● POST API: http://127.0.0.1:5000/add_review
This adds the review of the product id included in the request. The review gets appended in the input
file and is considered in subsequent sentiment analysis and summarization.
